Windows Desktop Application for Slidely AI.
In this task, we will be replicating the functionality of Google Forms in a Windows Desktop App.
We will be making both the desktop app as well as the backend.
It is well equipped with a user interface for viewing and creating the form submissions and is connected to a backend server made with TypeScript and Express.js.

This repository only contains the Frontend part.

This project is developed as a Windows Desktop Application using Visual Basic in Visual Studio. The application allows users to create new form submissions and view previously submitted forms. Additionally, the application features a stopwatch functionality on the form submission page.
